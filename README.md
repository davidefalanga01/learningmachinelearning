# LearningMachineLearning

### Goal:
This is Learning Machine Learning! This project serves as a comprehensive log of my journey to become an ML Engineer and what i would want to know if I start over. 

### Models:
The macro categories of models that you are:
* Machine Learning
  * Traditional models
  * Ensemble
  * Other valuable methods -> GMM, PCA

* Deep Learning
  * NN 
  * CNN
  * RNN -> LSTM
  * Transformer-based -> Bert, GPT, attention mechanism
  * Others:
    * Boltzmann
    * Hopfield
    * ART

* Reinforcement Learning
  * Q-learning
  * Policy-Based Methods
  * Model-Based RL
 


Integration of models 

### Other interesting topics:
* Genetic algorithms
* Robotics
